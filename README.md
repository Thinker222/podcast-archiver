# Podcast Archiver

This python script takes the feed URL of your favorite podcast and downloads all available episodes to your computer. Even those files "hidden" in a paged feed will be tapped, so you'll have an entire backup of the series.

## Outline

In my experience, very few full-fledged podcast clients are able to access a paged feed (following IETF RFC5005), so only the last few episodes of a podcast will be available to download. When you discover a podcast that has been around for quite a while, you'll have a hard time to follow the "gentle listener's duty" and listen to the whole archive. The script in this repository is supposed to help you aquiring every last episode of your new listening pleasure.

Before downloading any episode the function first fetches all available pages of the feed and prepares a list. That way, you will never miss any episode.

## Requirements

`podcast_archiver.py` requires Python 3+ and the `feedparser` library (among others, which are installed with Python by default).

## Usage

`podcast_archiver.py` takes command line arguments, containing for example the feeds that are supposed to be archived:

* `-f <url>` / `--feed=<url>`: Provide a feed-url that is to be archived. `-f` can be used multiple times, so you may hand over more than one feed to archive. To keep everything neat and tidy, see the `-s` option down below.
* `-d <path>` / `--dir=<path`: Specify the output directory for the archive, denoted by `<path>`. If omitted, the files are written to the current directory.
* `-s` / `--subdirs`: Create subdirectories for the provided feeds. This option enables reading the title of the feed and saving the episodes to a subdir of that title (of course invalid characters are removed first).
* `-v` / `--verbose`: Increase verbose level. In level 1 for example all download paths are shown. By default, `podcast_archiver` shows basic output on how many episodes are downloaded and shows the progress on those. Multiple `v`'s each increase the verbosity (currently only level 1 is used)
* 
Here's a full-fledged example of how I use `podcast_archiver`:
```
python3 podcast_archiver.py -d /Users/janwillhaus/Music/Podcasts -s \
    -f http://freakshow.fm/feed/m4a/ \
    -f http://alternativlos.org/alternativlos.rss \
    -f http://logbuch-netzpolitik.de/feed/m4a \
    -f http://not-safe-for-work.de/feed/m4a/ \
    -f http://raumzeit-podcast.de/feed/m4a/ \
    -f http://www.ard.de/static/radio/radiofeature/rss/podcast.xml \
    -f http://wir.muessenreden.de/feed/podcast/
```


## Todo

* Add ability to only add the latest episodes (without scanning *all* the feed pages). For example as `-u` / `--update.`
* Add ability to define a preferred format on feeds that contain links for multiple audio codecs.
* Add ability to define a range of episodes or time to download only episode from that point on or from there to the beginning or or or â€¦
* Add ability to choose a prefix episodes with the episode number (rarely necessary, since most podcasts feature some kind of episode numbering in the filename)
*
