# Podcast Archiver

This python script takes the feed URL of your favorite podcast and downloads all available episodes to your computer. Even those files "hidden" in a paged feed will be tapped, so you'll have an entire backup of the series.

## Outline

In my experience, very few full-fledged podcast clients are able to access a paged feed (following IETF RFC5005), so only the last few episodes of a podcast will be available to download. When you discover a podcast that has been around for quite a while, you'll have a hard time to follow the "gentle listener's duty" and listen to the whole archive. The script in this repository is supposed to help you aquiring every last episode of your new listening pleasure.
